## Instructions
We'd like for you to create simple SPA that will allow users to see a list of their studies in the cards mode.

## Objectives
  * Needs to have a way to display all the studies in the cards mode
  * API should be implemented and mocked in Redux layer

## General tips
  * API's mock data is provided in the public/mock_data folder
  * Feel free to pick any library you wish
  * Examine the API responses closely to determine what you can show
  * There's no UI guideline, but since you are a frontender we expect you to have certain level of detail
  * Do get in touch with us if you have any questions

## Deliverables
  * We expect you to submit to us a .zip file (without the `node_modules` folder, but with the .git folder) or access to a private github repo so we can inspect the code.
